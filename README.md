# Paper Assistant
This repository hosts the code for the Paper Assistant Web Application, a dynamic tool designed for researchers and academics. It allows users to build and manage a personalized database of research papers in PDF format. The application is equipped with several features, including paper summarization, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced information processing, and a search functionality to navigate through your collection of research documents efficiently. This user-friendly platform is ideal for streamlining research activities and accessing key information swiftly.
